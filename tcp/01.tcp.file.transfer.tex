1.Protocol
  String char buffer[] share between client and server
2.oganization
 -server
   + create socket
   + bind to port
   + listen to client
   + connect to client
   + read and write file which is sent from client.

 -client
   +create socket
   +connect to server port
   + read file from computer and write in buffer[] ,send to server
3. code snippet

    *server
	-read and write file which is sent from client.  

	FILE *fp;
         	int ch = 0;
		char buffer[512];
           	fp = fopen("labwork1_recv.txt","a");            		//open (create file name labwork1_recv.txt) 
            	int words;
		read(cli, &words, sizeof(int));					//read from client
            	
          	while(ch != words)						// write data to file labwork1_recv.txt
       	   	{
        	 	read(cli ,buffer, 512); 
	   	 	fprintf(fp , " %s" , buffer);   
		 	
		 	ch++;
	   	}



	*client
	-read file from computer and write in buffer[] ,send to server
	FILE *f;
    	char buffer[512];
    	int words = 0;
    	char c;
     	f=fopen("labwork1.txt","r");               //open file labwork
	
    	while((c=getc(f))!=EOF)			   // read file from computer
	{	
		fscanf(f , "%s" , buffer);
		if(isspace(c)||c=='\t')
		words++;	
	}
	
       
      
	write(serv, &words, sizeof(int));           
     	rewind(f);
      
        char ch ;                                       //write file was read
      	while(ch != EOF)
      	{
		fscanf(f , "%s" , buffer);
